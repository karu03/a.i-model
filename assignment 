To accomplish the tasks outlined, you can use Python along with libraries like `requests` for making HTTP requests, `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping, and `pandas` for handling data in a tabular format and exporting to a CSV file. Here's a simplified example of how you could approach this task:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

def search_and_scrape(query):
    # Make a request to the search engine API
    search_url = f"https://example.com/search?q={query}"
    response = requests.get(search_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parse the HTML content of the search results page
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        # Extract relevant information from the search results
        # (e.g., links to relevant websites)
        links = [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]
        # Scrape data from each relevant link
        scraped_data = []
        for link in links:
            # Make a request to the website
            page = requests.get(link)
            if page.status_code == 200:
                # Parse the HTML content of the page
                page_soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
                # Extract specific information based on the task requirements
                # (e.g., industry, competitors, financial performance)
                # Append the extracted data to the scraped_data list
        return scraped_data
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch search results")
        return None

# Task 1: Identify the industry in which Canoo operates, along with its size, growth rate, trends, and key players.
task1_query = "Canoo industry analysis"
task1_data = search_and_scrape(task1_query)

# Task 2: Analyze Canoo's main competitors, including their market share, products or services offered, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts.
task2_query = "Canoo competitors analysis"
task2_data = search_and_scrape(task2_query)

# Task 3: Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape.
task3_query = "market trends in electric vehicles industry"
task3_data = search_and_scrape(task3_query)

# Task 4: Gather information on Canoo's financial performance, including its revenue, profit margins, return on investment, and expense structure.
task4_query = "Canoo financial performance"
task4_data = search_and_scrape(task4_query)

# Once you have the scraped data for each task, you can structure it into a DataFrame
# and export it to a CSV file using pandas
# For demonstration purposes, let's assume we have some scraped data for each task
# and store it in lists
task1_data = [("Industry", "Electric Vehicles"), ("Size", "Large"), ("Growth Rate", "15%"), ("Key Players", ["Tesla", "Rivian", "Lucid Motors"])]
task2_data = [("Competitor", "Tesla"), ("Market Share", "40%"), ("Products/Services", ["Electric Cars", "Energy Products"]), ("Pricing Strategy", "High-end pricing"), ("Marketing Efforts", "High-profile events and sponsorships")]
task3_data = [("Trend", "Increased adoption of electric vehicles"), ("Impact", "Growing demand for EV charging infrastructure")]
task4_data = [("Metric", "Revenue"), ("Value", "$100 million"), ("Metric", "Profit Margin"), ("Value", "10%")]

# Create DataFrames for each task
df_task1 = pd.DataFrame(task1_data, columns=["Attribute", "Value"])
df_task2 = pd.DataFrame(task2_data, columns=["Attribute", "Value"])
df_task3 = pd.DataFrame(task3_data, columns=["Attribute", "Value"])
df_task4 = pd.DataFrame(task4_data, columns=["Attribute", "Value"])

# Export DataFrames to CSV files
df_task1.to_csv("task1_data.csv", index=False)
df_task2.to_csv("task2_data.csv", index=False)
df_task3.to_csv("task3_data.csv", index=False)
df_task4.to_csv("task4_data.csv", index=False)
```

Replace `"https://example.com/search?q={query}"` with the actual URL of the search engine API you plan to use, and implement the scraping logic inside the `search_and_scrape` function according to the structure of the websites you intend to scrape.
